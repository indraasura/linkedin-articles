Flexible Roadmap

Why: 

Roadmap planning, execution and tracking is fairly straightforward and simple before any product hits the market. Once it goes live and the initial set of hypothesis are tested - that is where the current and planned roadmap can go for a toss.

A flexible roadmap is the key to keep any business aligned with their vision as well as accomodate users - their wants and their needs. It also helps in better management and tracking of goals and mitigates debts caused by unforseen changes. 
Bottom line - flexibility of the roadmap is directly proportional to long-term success

How to build a roadmap that will serve well in the dark? 

1. Setting up a post-release workflow
- Sprint scopes are often (read: almost always) changed because of un-earthed bugs and user feedback once a feature set is live. This can be better managed by identifying potential workflows with their priorities
 - Break backlog features into SMART goals and incrementally include them in sprints
 - Sorting tasks based on the impact they will provide on the required outcome. For example, a P0 bug might take higher precedence over a much-awaited feature because the bug is a blocker for users. Labelling tasks based on effort and risk usually helps in prioritization
2. Visualise the roadmap 

3. Outcomes over outputs
