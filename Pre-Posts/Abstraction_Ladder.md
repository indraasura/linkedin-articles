# Abstraction Ladder 

Frame problems better with the abstraction ladder framework

The abstraction ladder will help define complex problems more clearly and advance the initial problem statement by providing a structured way to ask the right questions to navigate through the problem statement's granular levels.

How does the framework work? 

1. We start with the initial problem statement in the middle of the ladder 
2. Implement the 5-whys framework (ask "Why" questions) to further abstract and break down the problem statement
3. Ask "How" questions to start forming trivial solutions and move towards more concrete ones 

The top of the ladder further abstracts the problem statement - leads to better generalization and a better holistic view while the bottom of the ladder concretes the problem statement and might lead to the discovery of additional problem statements
