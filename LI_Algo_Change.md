# Change in the LI algo


LinkedIn has apparently changed it's algo against "virality" 

There was a time when I used to open LinkedIn and all I found were memes, reels reposted as posts and a wave of disappointment on the fact that LinkedIn too, had fallen in the trap of the general social media rule. But there's still hope. 

LinkedIn recently received a lot of feedback on the humongous amount of "irrelevant", "recycled" and "bloated" content on its feed. Posts structed with non-professional content and to "game the system" ("facebook/instagram-style" posts) received a massive underdog during the pandemic. The primary factor for this was the blurred lines between one's profession and their person. 

At that time, the platform's main purpose was to increase engagment and thus, they were centered around the virality of a post and how much and how many times can a viral post be consumed

It is therefore, important to understand why is LinkedIn shifting from virality and what is motivating the shift

There are two main reasons why LinkedIn is incorporating measures to shift away from virality: 

- The first is straightforward - the major consensus of post feedback was the degree of irrelevency and repetition. LinkedIn is filled with professionals, and the sudden spike in "fad influencers" saw a significant reduction in posts that genuinely provided knowledge without any hidden sales pitch. 

- The second is the core competancy of the platform itself. LinkedIn found itself merging to become "yet another social platform" and not what it was built and bought for. 

With the recent changes, LinkedIn has already seen an 80% reduction in the number of complaints on irrelevent content

What were the changes?

1. Increased likeliness of first-degree connections seeing what you post - increases the value of what users see on their feed

2. Higher prioritization and rewards for posts that share "knowlegde and advices" - segregates promotions and bloats from what is truly the demand

How does LI differentiate or prioritize posts with "high knowledge" v/s posts that don't fall under this category? 

A few metrics that help highlight the relevant parameters are: 

- The post is targetted to a specific audience and does not indicate generic segments 
- The post has a close association with the author's core subject area 
- The number of "meaningful" comments on the post 
- Identifying whether the post contains "generic information" or "original perspectives and insights" (The latter is rewarded more as compared to the former)
