Flexible Roadmap

Why: 

Roadmap planning, execution and tracking is fairly straightforward and simple before any product hits the market. Once it goes live and the initial set of hypothesis are tested - that is where the current and planned roadmap can go for a toss.

A flexible roadmap is the key to keep any business aligned with their vision as well as accomodate users - their wants and their needs. It also helps in better management and tracking of goals and mitigates debts caused by unforseen changes. 
Bottom line - flexibility of the roadmap is directly proportional to long-term success
