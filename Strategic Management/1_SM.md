# What is corporate strategy and why is it important 

What makes formulating and maintaining a corporate strategy difficult is that strategy is never static due to changing environments and markets. This demands that organizations stay on their toes and perform constant adjustments to meet new demands 

It therefore becomes very important to get into the nuances of what exactly are the considerations that need to be taken care of when making strategic decisions 

1. Long-term orientation of the org
2. Purpose of the org
3. Attainment of a competitive advantage 
4. Adaptability to changes
5. Expandability of resources and the org efficiency 
6. Corporate philosophy 
7. Stakeholder expectations 

A sound strategic decision cannot be built on a hastend strategic plan
