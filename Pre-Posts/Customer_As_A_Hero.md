The Hero's Journey is a narrative framework that explores the transformational journey of a protagonist. By applying this framework to product design, you can create a user-centric experience that resonates with your audience. 

Before we go into the breakdown of the different steps, let us understand why this works: 

- Helps us to connect with our users 
- Teaches us how to think, act and empathize
- Helps us realize that customers are not blank slates when they interact with products 

Here's a breakdown of the different parts of the framework and what each of them mean

1. Hero (Identify)
It is important to determine the hero of the story - recognize and understand the customer. What does the hero want and what's keeping them from getting it? 

2. Setup (Connect)
Setup is all about the expectations of the hero - what can the hero expect from the product? What will be their emotional state when they transform via the product's experience? 

3. Hook (Get hooked)
This is the moment when the hero realizes that they can transform their life - the so-called "Aha moment". We need to think about how to get the users invest time in using the product and getting the most of it

4. Transformation (Invest)
What has the hero realized during their journey from start to end? This is the moment that people watching an F1 race have been waiting for - this is where the anticipation leads and they realise and cheer for their favorite driver winning - The hero of the product should be excited to reach the end of their destination

5. Ending (Pay off)
What has the hero achieved by the end of their journey? What is their emotional state? Who are they with? What will keep bringing them back to re-live this experience over and over again? 

Summary: 
Recognize the customer as the hero of the product, not the product itself
Deeply understand their journey and where the product can play the supporting role
