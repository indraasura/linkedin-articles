# Customer as a hero

###### Source: Dropbox(https://dropbox.design/article/the-customer-as-hero)

- People often talk about customers as if they are the audience of a show that the organization is creating - rather than the hero of the show itself

- A better practice would be to re-imagine the hero of the story as the customer so that we can put ourselves in their shoes and understand how they think or feel in any given moment

- USE THE LANGUAGE OF STORYTELLING IN THE DESIGN PROCESS
