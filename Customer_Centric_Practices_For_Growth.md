The best way to endure a business downturn and shift focus from growth to endurance is to shift from products to people. 

This will not only help build stronger customer relations but will reduce the cost of acquisition, increase revenue and scale and grow in a sustainable fashion. 

Embedding customer-centric practices helps feed growth and is at the core of a durable growth strategy. 

Get to know your customer
= understand your customer before product development 
= more user research
= understand the voice of the customer and how to capture it 

Use customer-centric tools 
= a function that is not strengthening your relations with customers is of no use 

Setting up for success
= lead organizations to follow a customer-centric approach by changing priorities and the approach to solving problems 

Stay relevant 
= keep yourself updated with the latest concepts in the industry 
= try to apply concepts of the human psyche to gain teh extra edge
